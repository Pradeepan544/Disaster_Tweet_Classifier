# 🌪️ Disaster Tweet Classification

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying tweets as related to disasters or not. By utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this project aims to create an efficient model that can assist in identifying and responding to disaster events.

## 📁 Contents

- **Dataset**: The raw data used for training and testing the model.
- **EDA**: Exploratory data analysis files that provide insights into the dataset.
- **Model**: The trained machine learning model for disaster tweet classification.
- **Pickled Model**: A serialized version of the trained model for easy deployment.

## 📊 Dataset

- The dataset consists of various tweets labeled as disaster or non-disaster-related.
- It is designed to help train the model to recognize patterns and features indicative of disaster-related tweets.

## 🔍 Data Preprocessing

- Preprocessing steps include:
  - Cleaning the text data (removing URLs, mentions, hashtags).
  - Tokenization and normalization (lowercasing, stemming/lemmatization).
  - Encoding labels for model training.

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA section provides:
- Summary statistics of the dataset.
- Visualizations to explore the distribution of tweet classes and key features.
- Insights into the textual content of disaster-related tweets.

## 🤖 Model Training

- Various machine learning algorithms were applied to train the classification model.
- The model's performance was evaluated using appropriate metrics, ensuring reliability in classifying tweets.
